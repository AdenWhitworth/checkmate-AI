"""
Chess Position Evaluation and Analysis Script
=============================================

This script leverages the Stockfish chess engine to evaluate chess positions, retrieve top moves, 
and analyze specific moves from a given board state. It is designed for chess enthusiasts, 
developers, and AI researchers who need an efficient way to evaluate and understand chess positions.

Features
--------
1. **Stockfish Initialization**:
   - Configures the Stockfish engine with customizable threads and skill levels for efficient evaluation.

2. **Position Evaluation**:
   - Evaluates a given chess position in FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) format.
   - Retrieves the overall evaluation of the position and evaluations of the top legal moves.

3. **Move Analysis**:
   - Evaluates specific moves from a given FEN position to determine their quality.

4. **Result Display**:
   - Formats and prints the evaluation results in a human-readable format, including centipawn (CP) and mate scores.

5. **Modular Design**:
   - Each functionality is encapsulated in reusable functions to enhance readability, reusability, and maintainability.

6. **Customizable Depth and Moves**:
   - Users can specify the depth of Stockfishâ€™s search and the number of top moves to retrieve.

Inputs
------
- **FEN String**: A string representing the chess board state.
- **Move**: UCI (Universal Chess Interface) notation of a move to analyze (optional).
- **Stockfish Configuration**: Path to the Stockfish executable, number of threads, and skill level.

Outputs
-------
- **Overall Position Evaluation**: The assessment of the given position in terms of centipawn or mate score.
- **Top Moves Evaluation**: List of the top legal moves and their evaluations.
- **Specific Move Evaluation**: Evaluation of a specific move from the given position.
